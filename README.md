A creative and enthusiastic 2nd year Technical Game Development student 
and volunteer with Enactus as Project Leader. 
Many of my strengths directly relate to the development of games or other software/applications. 
I have six years of programming experience within education, 
primarily in C# and python, and I hope to continue to develop 
relevant skills through a placement in the software development
or game development industries.
